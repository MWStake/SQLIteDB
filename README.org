* SQLite on MediaWiki

You must set the environment variable =MW_INSTALL_PATH= to your mediawiki root to use this extension.

In order to install on a SQLite DB this extension tells [[https://getcomposer.org/][composer]] how to autoload it.  This is necessary so that when you specify “sqlite” as the db type during installation, it can find the right db driver.  It also allows MediaWiki to use [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgDBtype][$wgDBtype]] to find the provided =DatabasePercona= class.

Because of this bootstrapping, composer's autoloader needs to be able to use MediaWiki's autoloader and we make it available by loading [[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:AutoLoader.php][$MW_INSTALL_PATH/includes/AutoLoader.php]].
